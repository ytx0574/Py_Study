README for Unique 0.1
=====================

Unique will be a system for uniquely storing ``normalize`` objects in
a unique B-Tree, with a backing store which records history and makes
it hard to tamper with: git.  It could be used as a basic key/value
store, given a suitably lax storage schema.  But its goal is to be a
useful first normal form (1NF) store.

This is currently in very early stages of development.  Please contact
the author or send pull requests if you want to get involved!  See
TODO.org for the roadmap.
